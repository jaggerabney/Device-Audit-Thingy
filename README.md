# Device Audit Thingy

This is a script I've been plinking away at during work hours to help the district's inventory guy. It pulls info from various spreadsheets to create a master inventory list that'll be inputted into the district's new ticketing software. I chose Java because it's the language I'm most comfortable with - sue me, C# nerds - and because I hate working with VBA.
